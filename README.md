# Skill_extraction

Skill_extraction from Resumes API

## SCOPE :

We wanted to Build an API which will take resume text and return skills (Hard and Soft).

We have build this API using [SkillNER](https://github.com/AnasAito/SkillNER.git) repo. We have plans of finetuning SkillNer's repo and making it much better and leaner.
